Gene,Related to EMT?,Notes,Reference
HMGA2,yes,"upregulated during EMT, especially in cancer progression",
MTA3,indirect,can inhibit EMT by regulating Snail expression,
HBEGF,yes,"growth facor that promotes EMT, particularly in the context of cancer",
CXADR,no,,
THBS1,yes,"ECM protein that modulated cell-to-cell interactions, protmoes EMT-associated cell migration",

CLDN3,no,,
NFKB1,indirect,inflammation induced EMT,
PEBP1,indirect,implicated in signaling pathways that can influence EMT,
SNAI1,yes,repressed CDH1 expression and induces EMT by promoting mesenchymal phenotype,
ID2,indirect,inhibits TF activity (TWIST) to inhibit EMT,
CREB1,indirect,involved in various cellular processes,
RELA,indirect,"part of NKB1 pathway, its activation can promote EMT under certain conditions",
